			"The Abstract Almanac" is a source of information on a worldbuilding project, taking place<br>
			in a dimension referred to as The Cosm. The project was born out of a love of<br> 
			creating original species and a desire to present a world that feels as close to<br>
			truly "new" as one can get. Strange environments and fantastical beings, the particles they're<br>
			comprised of and the ancient energies they're ruled by - You can read up on all of it here, <br>
			and take a glimpse into The Cosm.
			<br>
			<br>
			A physical book compiling this information is currently in the works, the pages of which<br>
			will be uploaded on TheNikwell's social medias as they are produced.<br></b>

			That's me, hello! I go by "TheNikwell" online, and I'm an artist, animator, composer,<br>
			and worldbuilder. I've been drawing since I was very young, and making my own species for<br>
			just as long. They got more fleshed out as time went on, until I felt they ought to have<br>
			a world they reside in, and things kicked off from there. <br>
			<br>
			It's always struck me how all creativity is essentially rehashing things we've seen before.<br>
			Same material, different presentation. You could say I have a sort of Lovecraftian drive to bring<br>
			ideas that are truly "new" to the table. Yes, it's a tall order - as tall as imagining<br>
			a new color - but the idea of pushing the limits of imagination is captivating to me, and<br>
			this project has been a way to do that.</b>
